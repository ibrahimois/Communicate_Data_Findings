# Ford GoBike System Dataset Exploration
## by Ibrahim Alsagaby


## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
     Note that this dataset will require some data wrangling in order to make it tidy for analysis. There are multiple cities covered by the         linked system, and multiple data files will need to be joined together if a full year’s coverage is desired.
    If you’re feeling adventurous, try adding in analysis from other cities, following links from [this page] or [this page].


## Summary of Findings

> A lot has been found, yet so little can be told, we saw that the gender type can change the duration of the trip, age too
and we saw how the members take trips in the week days more than the week-ends, and the amount of trips a lot of the time start at 7AM or 5PM



## Key Insights for Presentation

> in this investigation, i want to show some interesting relations between some features of our system users.
